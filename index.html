        <h1>Hey, I&rsquo;m John.</h1>
        
        <h2>My job is making soccer make sense. 
            <br><br>
            Right now I&rsquo;m building a soccer startup and doing player recruitment consulting for clubs.
            <br><br>
            Before that, I spent three years as a senior football writer at The Athletic.
            My writing has also appeared in FiveThirtyEight, the Guardian, the New York Times,
            and a newsletter called space space space.
            <br><br>
            I&rsquo;ve moderated the soccer panel at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference,
            spoken at FC Barcelona's Sports Tomorrow Congress and the American Soccer Insights Summit, and appeared on
            The Athletic Tactics Podcast, Tifo Football, and lots of other shows.
