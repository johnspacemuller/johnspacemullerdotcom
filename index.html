        <h2>My job is making soccer make sense. 
            <br><br>
            Right now I&rsquo;m building a soccer startup and doing player recruitment consulting for clubs.
            <br><br>
            Before that, I spent three years as a senior football writer at <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/author/john-muller/">The Athletic</a>.
            My writing has also appeared in <a href = "https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/john-muller/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, the New York Times,
            and a newsletter called <a href = "https://spacespacespaceletter.com/">space space space</a>.
            <br><br>
            I&rsquo;ve moderated the soccer panel at the <a href = "https://www.sloansportsconference.com/event/soccers-analytics-frontier">Sloan Sports Analytics Conference</a>,
            spoken at FC Barcelona's Sports Tomorrow Congress, and appeared on
            The Athletic Tactics Podcast, Tifo Football, and lots of other shows. 
            A buddy and I host a podcast called <a href = "https://postscriptpod.substack.com/">Post Script</a> 
            about the history of soccer analysis blogs.
            <br><br>
